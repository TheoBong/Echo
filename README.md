# Echo Spigot Plugin
Echo is a screenshare tool for catching cheaters in minecraft. This plugin allows you to more efficently run scans through echo directly through the server.

To download the plugin, visit: https://github.com/TheoBong/Echo/releases
You must have an API Key to use this. Get an Echo API Key by purchasing an Echo License here: https://echo.ac/#pricing

Features:
* **Staff API Keys** - each staff member must use their own API key, this data is stored in a json file.
* **Automatic Screensharing** - run a simple /freeze command and it will automatically generate a download link and keep you updated on the status of the scan.
* **Freezing** - completely freezes a player and runs a variety of tasks that any regular freeze plugin would have.
* **Configurable** - almost every message and aspect of the plugin is configurable via a config.yml
* **Free** - available for download and usage at no cost, and permissively licensed so it can remain free forever.

## Frequently Asked Questions
